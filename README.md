Learning the Django framework by building a basic blog

To my understangind, I can build an html template that I use for static pages, and then include it in "template", and Django will take the data and python instructions in "views" and aggregate it with the template, producing the final HTML that gets displayed to the end user.

To run server:
python manage.py runserver

To do:

1. Fix urlconfig so I can add the about_me page and start coding the blog page
